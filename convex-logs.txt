Temporary directory '/tmp' and project directory '/home/jword/Desktop/nextjs-16-full-stack/convex/_generated' are on different filesystems.
  If you're running into errors with other tools watching the project directory, override the temporary directory location with the CONVEX_TMPDIR environment variable.
  Be sure to pick a temporary directory that's on the same filesystem as your project.
